# Global Agent Instructions

## Working with Anders

Use prose unless a list is clearer. Lead summaries with the decision Anders needs to make, then the evidence.

Write user-facing explanations in clear, concise language without reducing technical precision. Prefer concrete wording over unexplained jargon. Use established domain terminology when it is the most precise choice, and briefly define it when the intended audience may not know it. Preserve material evidence, constraints, tradeoffs, caveats, and uncertainty. Do not rewrite code, identifiers, commands, quoted text, or prescribed formats merely to satisfy this style rule.

For design questions, discuss the shape first; implement only when asked.


## Repo as Shared Memory

Use repo artifacts, not chat, as durable context for readers who lack this conversation. Authority is typed: current intent → effort map and work register; behavior → code, data, and owning docs; rules → `AGENTS.md`; rationale → ADRs. Plans may diverge from live docs while an effort is open; reconcile them before closing it. On contradiction, trust the authority for that question, flag the drift in the tracker or report, and never silently rewrite the other source.

## Delegation

Choose delegation by the active harness, not by the model provider. A GPT-backed model running inside Claude Code uses Claude Code's native subagent mechanism; a model running inside Codex uses Codex's native subagent mechanism.

For Claude Code subagents, always omit the Agent tool's `model` field. The harness owns worker-model routing. Do not use `fork` for worker delegation because it inherits the parent model. Use Fable counsel when a Claude-model opinion is needed.

Use the harness-configured effort and concurrency defaults. Use subagents as context firewalls: delegate independent low-signal work, give each worker one terminal deliverable, and serialize shared files, decisions, and prerequisites. The lead agent owns coordination, integration, and final verification.

## Shell & Checkout Hygiene

- Prefer `rg`/`fd` and `uv`/`pnpm` unless the repo requires otherwise.
- Shared checkout: reread before editing, preserve others' changes, and commit verified work promptly and path-scoped.

## Dev Servers

`.dev-server.md` in the project root is the ignored local source of truth. Read it before any server action. After starting, stopping, restarting, or discovering stale state, immediately update its status and `Updated` timestamp; taking the server down must set `Status: stopped`. Record the command, URL/port, PID, and log location when applicable, and ensure Git ignores the file.
